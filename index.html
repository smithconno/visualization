Visualization Essay

<p>
Forbes.com has a great article about the problem that is national debt and how we can fix this issue. National debt will never go away but lowering it will be huge for our economy. They believe opening the borders would be the first step in this process, as they think many workers from all over the world could come in and create more business opertunities which would help pay taxes. Another big thing is the regulation of businesses. By increasing costs and inefficiency, the regulation of businesses damages the economy by a whopping one trillion dollars. Yes, one TRILLION. Lowering income tax rates would also be a major boost to the economy. Also, without being particular there are plenty of countries around the world that have found out ways to decrease their national debt so using those countries as some sort of template would definitely help out. This is a great visualization because it is very easy to read without feeling like it is a chore. They made slides with pictures around the words so the reader could stay interested, the facts they gave were very intellectual.

My example of a poor visualization is anb article done by SB Nation, a NFL blog, about a "problem" that the NFL is running out of high end quarterbacks to play. This is the definition of click bait. It talks about how top quarterbacks are getting hurt already this year, eventhough this happens every year. Injuries are inevitable in the game of football. This website does not include any type of intellegence at all, and the text is not easy or fun to read.
